 *
 * this program takes a string as run time argument and 
 * find whether the string elements are vowel or not.
 *
 * this can be done using the arguments of main() function which are argc and argv
 * The OS passes each command line argument as a string in the argv array.The program’s 
 * name (./ex13) is at 0, with the rest coming after it.
 * The OS also sets argc to the number of arguments in the argv array, so you can process
 * them without going past the end. Remember that if you give one argument, the program’s
 * name is the first, so argc is 2
